	        movie's database corresponding values in order for the 
		movieto be printed.
		
		the input title and rating values can be complete or 
		partial words, and the search will match them to th 
		movie's corresponding values as long as they start with 
		the exact samecharacters ( the search is case sensitive )

		the year value can be a complete 4 digit year or '?' 
		can be used as wildcards in case the full year is not 
		known.
